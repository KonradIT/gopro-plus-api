## GoPro Plus API (unofficial!)

# GoPro Plus Media Service unofficial API.

This is a python, go and ruby wrapper for the GoPro Plus cloud storage API. You can learn more about GoPro Plus [here](https://shop.gopro.com/subscription/gopro-plus-monthly/GoProPlusMonthly.html), essentially its a cloud service that allows your HERO5 camera to offload media into the cloud without the need of a middleman device, just a power adapter and a wifi internet connection. This is really convenient as you don't have to carry a laptop or a phone sd card/usb adapter (otg, quickkey, etc...) when you travel. Its 5$/mo and you get a maximum storage capacity of "35 hours of video, 62,500 photos or a combination of the two. Videos and photos are stored at up to 1440p and 12MP". 

The goal of this 3rd party wrapper is to provide sync to desktop without the need of using their GoPro Quik app or front-end web, also automating the whole process. This can be later used to offload GoPro Plus media to a hard-drive or to another online service.

You can use this wrapper if you want to use the python/golang/ruby version, if you're looking for the HTTP API calls go to the [documentation](https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-plus-api/wiki/API-calls) page.
